# GPLVMHaskell

## What do we need to do for GPLVM implementation.

Final goal: formalization of GPLVM via Haskell type system to propose a general framework to GPLVM.

1. Consider the general case of PCA and PPCA and formalize in Haskell. Provide the way to work with PCA and PPCA;
2. Similarly with Gaussian process;
3. Research the current abilities of probabilistic programming, machine learning, and Bayes inference in Haskell;
4. Similarly with linear algebra in Haskell, the most of observed libraries are quite old;
5. Define the list of required mathematical constructions and operations from algebra, probability theory and numeric analysis.
6. Formalize GPLVM using the background above: general GPLVM and demo application.
